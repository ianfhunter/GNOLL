# How to Contribute
We're so happy you're considering contributing! Thank you! We hope this document will make it easier to do that.

# Process
Please assign yourself to a ticket, or request this, so anyone looking doesn't work on the same thing! Clone the code, make your changes, add a test & create a PR! We'll try to review it as soon as we can

# Scope
DiceTower is specifically designed to be a library for Dice Notation. What that means is, that we are looking for contributions that expand, improve or simplify parsing that notation. TTRPG character creation/storage, Encounter tracking or any other game mechanics are **out of scope** and are best handled as a wrapper around DiceTower.
Similarly, DiceTower is not overly concerned about the graphical display of the results, but the actual results themselves. We may only consider these contributions on a per-case basis.

# New Language Support
We would love it if you added a language not yet on our list. We have two things for you to observe first though.
1. Please add a test so we will know if it breaks!
2. Try to use the existing C code, if you think there is no way to do this, please mention it in our issues/discussion tab so we can discuss alternatives. We'd really like to avoid duplicating files!
