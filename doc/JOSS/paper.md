# Summary

GNOLL is a highly compatible dice-rolling library supporting a large range of dice notation syntax common in tabletop roleplaying (TTRPG) games.

# Statement of Need
Whilst there are several dice rolling utilities on the market for research/commercial use there is no current solution which is:
- Open source 
- Using a low level language like C for maximal integration
- Multiple language bindings
- supporting multiple notation standards
- supporting non-simplex combinations of notation. 

While some solutions may offer one or two of these, GNOLL addresses all of these points.

# Mathematics
GNOLL builds upon actual use-cases of how dice are specified in software, rather than theoretical mathematical notations.
The simplest of these representations is {x}d{y} where x and y are integers. This asks that we roll X number of Y-sided dice. e.g. 3d6 would be requesting 3 6-sided dice.
