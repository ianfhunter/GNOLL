    title = "Troll, a Language for specifying Dice-rolls",
    abstract = "Dice are used in many games, and often in fairly complex ways that make it difficult to unambiguously describe the dice-roll mechanism in plain language.Many role-playing games, such as Dungeons & Dragons, use a formalised notation for some instances of dice-rolls. This notation, once explained, make dice-roll descriptions concise and unambiguous. Furthermore, the notation has been used in automated tools for pseudo-random dice-rolling (typically used when playing over the Internet).This notation is, however, fairly limited in the types of dice-rolls it can describe, so most games still use natural language to describe rolls. Even Dungeons & Dragons use formal notation only for some of the dice-roll methods used in the game. Hence, a more complete notation is in this paper proposed, and a tool for pseudo-random rolls and (nearly) exact probability calculations is described.The notation is called {"}Troll{"}, combining the initial of the Danish word for dice ({"}terninger{"}) with the English word {"}roll{"}. It is a development of the language Roll described in an earlier paper. The present paper describes the most important features of Troll and its implementation.",
