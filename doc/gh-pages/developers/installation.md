## Something Else?
### SWIG
The swig bindings are already generated for you in `src/swig/gnoll.i`. Follow the specific instructions in the SWIG documentation to build your own binding.
Note: The current bindings do not return a result directly - You should read from the file that is generated.

### Shared Library
Many languages allow importing of code via shared object. You can find this .o file in the build folder after running `make all`
