# GNOLL

Welcome to GNOLL's documentation! [Looking for the Git repository?](https://github.com/ianfhunter/GNOLL)

The aim of GNOLL is to provide the world with a dice parsing library that:
- Is simple to use (By the general public, not by statisticians)
- Is easy to integrate into up-and-coming software projects
- Is performant
- Supports a wide range of dice notation formats and operations.
- Can be used as a reference implementation for others trying to understand dice notation.

If you're looking to set up GNOLL, read our [Technical Setup](developers/installation.html)

Want to understand dice notation? You can start by understanding the basic types of dice and following [Grindon's Tale](notation/numeric_dice.md), or click into any interesting topic on the sidebar.
