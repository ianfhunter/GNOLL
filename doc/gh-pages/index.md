Welcome to the GNOLL documentation!

It is current under construction as we migrate from [our Wiki](https://github.com/ianfhunter/GNOLL/wiki)

The aim of GNOLL is to provide the world with a library to make parsing dice notation as simple as possible, without compromising on functionality or performance. We too wish to provide direction on shaping dice notation standards.

Want to understand dice notation? Start by understanding the basic types of dice and following [Grindon's Adventure](#).
