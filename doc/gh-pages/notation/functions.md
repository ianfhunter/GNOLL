# Functions

Writing user functions is not implemented in GNOLL to avoid overwhelming users. Not all who use GNOLL are programming literate.

Generally, you should not need to use this feature, unless you're doing something very obscure.

There are a limited set of predefined functions that can be used in GNOLL:

| Function             | Example      | Description                         |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| max(dice, dice)      | max(1,2) = 2 | Get the larger number               |
| min(dice, dice)      | min(1,2) = 1 | Get the smaller number              |
| abs(dice)            | abs(-2) = 2  | Ensure the number will be positive  |
