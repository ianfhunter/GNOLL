>**GM**: Well, you took a load of damage, but you did level up.
>
>**Grindon**: Nice, I get my class feature - I can reroll 1s!
>
>**GM**: Do you remember how to do that?
>
>**Grindon**: Yep, I just do a "1d20r==1"
>
>*GNOLL*: [9]
>
>**GM**: Great. Remember, you could still get a 1 on your second roll.

>**Grindon**: Yeah, but then I deserved it.

Rerolling is often based on conditions (e.g. reroll if result is a 1). There are two options when using these conditions
- Reroll once
- Reroll until the condition is no longer true.

We represent these as "ro" and "r" respectively.


## Repeat Dice Rolls
If you wish to run the same thing several times, you can use "xN" to re-do an operation. Note that this will produce N results, not 1.


## Conditional Rolling

*Under Construction*

<!--
```
   GM: There's a set of 4 levers on the wall, they seem to control the gate blocking you from the next room
   Grindon The Brave: I randomly pull them up and down
   GM: Uh.. Okay - Roll some fate die and if you get a "+" it's in the right position
   Grindon The Brave: Cool - "4dFc"
   GNOLL: [2]
   GM: The gate shudders, but remains still
   Grindon The Brave: Ugh, I hate puzzles. I'll just hit it with my axe..
   GM: *Sigh*...
```

Some systems may get you to roll subsequent rolls on certain conditions. For example, if you roll a 1 on a d20, maybe your magic spell explodes, causing 1d6 damage to everyone around them. To express this we use conditions.

These follow a *ternary* syntax, which is to say:
> initial_roll_and_condition[do_if_condition_met|otherwise_do_this]
> d20#1[d6|p]

There are some key-letters which may be used:
 - **P** - Persist. Use the initial Roll again
 - **S** - Scrap. Remove the initial roll (if there is no other value mentioned, 0 will be the result value)
