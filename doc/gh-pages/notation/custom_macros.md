>**GM**: You wake up from your dream, finding an old creature resembling to a witch. Seeing your bleeding head, it offers you to choose a potion.
>
>**Grindon**: Can I pick the healing potion?

>**GM**: Almost. There is one bright-green healing potion. There is also one deep-red deadly potion, that would also help with your bleeding head, but not with your quest. And finally an intriguing blue potion, full of sprinkles swirling inside the bottle.

## Usage

*This is an advanced feature. Feel free to ask us for help!*

There are certain system-specific [[Built-In Macros]] for you to take advantage of.

Before rolling your dice, you can define some macros

All strings (words) must be capitalized. This is to avoid confusion with the rest of the dice notation

`$EVENSIX= {2,4,6,8,10,12}`

You can use ranges

`$DTWENTYBONUS = {1..20, 30}`

You can also use words

`$FRIENDS={JOHN,MARY,TAI}`
